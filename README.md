# Stian Stordal - FrontEnd Developer

### Hello There! :wave: <br>
My name is Stian, and i am a :computer: FrontEnd Developer with a passion for combining creativity and logic. 
I am a ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ Norwegian 27-year old, and i speak ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡©ğŸ‡° scandinavian languages and ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ english fluently.

I value teamwork and discipline above all else and I like to work with people who have the same interest in their work as i do, and love what they do as much as i do.

As a developer i have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and have a need for continously expanding my knowledge in my field. I like working with CSS and JS an have taken an interest in working with animations, but i also like working with logic "puzzles".

There is also a soft spot in my heart for design, and i try to be up to date with the latest trends when i design my own websites.
